And now it's time to play. Scramble is a game (currently popular on smart phones) that challenges you to find as many words as possible in a 4Ã—4 grid of letters before a timer expires. Each pair of letters in a word can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Below, for instance, is what the game looks like on an iPhone (at 4:33am). Present are words like LOTS, NO, NOD, and SUM, along with (believe it or not) 308 other words.

uffice it to say we need your help finishing this implementation of scramble! And just a couple other favors, too, if you don't mind!

    Complete the implementation of draw (using some loops and printf) in such a way that grid[i][j] represents the letter in row i, column j. You're welcome to stray from the aesthetics of the staff's own solution.
    Complete the implementation of lookup in such a way that the function returns true iff (i.e., if and only if) word is in dictionary. Odds are you can do better than linear search!
    Complete the implementation of scramble (the function) in such a way that the grid is rotated anytime the user types SCRAMBLE, per the comments therein. Note that this feature doesn't affect the words in the grid; it simply lets the user see them from different perspective.
    By default, the distribution code is case-sensitive, whereby if FOO is in dictionary, the user must type FOO, not foo, in order to score. Alter main in such a way that the user can type FOO or foo (or even FoO or any other capitalization thereof) in order to score.
